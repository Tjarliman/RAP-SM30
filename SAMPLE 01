STEP 1:
Create a table in SE11, make sure to indclude administration fields (createdby, createddt,changedby, changeddt, etc...and time as well), and also this field lastchanged : abp_lastchange_tstmpl;
Sample of codes: 
@EndUserText.label : 'Interface Master List'
@AbapCatalog.enhancement.category : #NOT_EXTENSIBLE
@AbapCatalog.tableCategory : #TRANSPARENT
@AbapCatalog.deliveryClass : #A
@AbapCatalog.dataMaintenance : #ALLOWED
define table ztj_intf_master {
  key mandt   : mandt not null;
  key intfid  : edoc_interface_id not null;
  intfnm      : edoc_interface_desc;
  intfdir     : edoc_interface_dir;
  include /isdfps/admin_task;
  lastchanged : abp_lastchange_tstmpl;

}

STEP 2:
In ADT, right click your table, and chose Generate ABAP repository objects, if you dont have this, probably you need to update your ADT to the last version
Pick ABAP Restfull...: UI Service
In the next screen:
Data Model: ZTJ_I_INTF_MASTER ( add _I_ as our data model, following SAP naming convention)
Behavior: CLass: ZTJ_CL_INTF_MASTER, Draft: ZTJ_INTF_MASTERD
Service Projection: ZTJ_C_INTF_MASTER
Service Definition: ZTJ_SD_INTF_MASTER
Service Binding: ZTJ_SB_INTF_MASTER
Click Next, then next again to get the TR#
Click Finish
Once finished, we need to publish the service

STEP 3:
Click Publish
If any errors occured, you can publish it following this docs: https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-q-a/error-while-publishing-v4-version-service-with-rap/qaq-p/12620864#:~:text=7%20Kudos.%20You%20have%20to%20use%20the%20transaction%20/iwfnd/v4_admin%20to

STEP 4:
Test your service, you will notice the admin fields need to be populated, you need to create a logic for that or try to add semantics annotation at data model level...(still could not find the best one)

STEP 5:
Publish your RAP as FIORI Apps (you will need Business Application Studiio at BTP or use Visual Studio Code (VSC)
